	<body> <h1> Hey! </h1>
	<p> My name is Sofia Gonzalez-Bartolome, I am 20 years old attending The New School University in New York City 
	studying Journalism and Design, along with a minor in Religious Studies. I was born in Puerto Rico in a town called 
	Rio Piedras. I am of Puerto Rican, Filipino, Venezuelan and Brazillian background, which makes me a mega-mutt.
	When I was 15 years old my family of 6 (my mother, father, 4 older brothers and I) packed our bags and moved to the
	land of opportunities, The United States. I started a new high school in North Bergen, NJ and once I graduated, attended TNS.
		This is my website, about my earlier life, school life, and everything else inbetween.</p>
