Sofia Gonzalez-Bartolome
About me: I was born in Rio Piedras, Puerto Rico of Puerto Rican, Filipino, Venezuelan and Brazillian background. In the time I was living in Puerto Rico,
I lived in multiple cities across the island with my parents and 4 older brothers. 
At the age of 15 my family packed our bags and moved to the land of opportunities, The United States. 
I started a new high school in North Bergen, NJ and once I graduated, attended The New School University in New York City
studying Journalism and Design.
